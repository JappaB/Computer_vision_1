num_cols = floor(cols/region_size)

% 2. For each region compute A, A T and b. Then, estimate optical flow as
% given in Equation 20.

% First create a vector for the T dimension
T = ones(rows, cols);
T = T*time_step;

% Partial derivatives Ix, Iy and It


% Matrix A, Matrix A transposed and vector b

% vector v


% 3. When you have estimation for optical flow (V x , V y ) of each region, you
% should display the results. There is a MATLAB function quiver which
% plots a set of two-dimensional vectors as arrows on the screen. Try to
% figure out how to use this to plot your optical flow results.
